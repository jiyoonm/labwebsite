This is a 6 page website where you have to choose between a guitarist and a drummer and explore their accompanying intruments. The further keep you get in the website, the closer in the instruments you get. Because the website intially diverge into two parallel pages and storylines, I chose a guitar and drumset two represent these paths as they often accompany each other in performences.
